            <h1>Dear friends,</h1>
            <p>I'm moving away (just for the summer most likely) and I'm going to miss you. It would be an honor to see you one last time (but I'm probably coming back so it won't be the last last time) so I'm throwing myself a little going away party. I hate being in the spot light and I don't like big events so I'm going to keep this small and short. See the details below and I'll see you there!<br>-Nate
            </p>
